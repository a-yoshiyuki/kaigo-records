Thank you for visiting my repository!<br>
This repository is a portfolio created by utilizing the knowledge gained from learning Ruby on Rails.

[Explanation of the app]<br>
This app mainly created the function to enter and save records at the nursing care site.<br>
In addition, the administrator and staff are separated by namespace, and the administrator can manage the staff and users and view the records, and the staff can enter and view the records.

The reason I decided to make this app was that my current workplace record was still on paper.<br>
For paper-based records, physical space is required to store the records and the cost of purchasing paper is also high. In addition, it was time-consuming to prepare a new recording sheet for each record by filling in the necessary items after midnight.<br>
I came up with the idea of creating this app because I thought that if I could manage the records in the app, I would be free from those problems.

At the group home where I work, I thought about how to make it easy to use.
